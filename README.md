# PHP benchmark with results insert

A PHP benchmark script with results insert into database. Credit to Paul Taulborg (njaguar at https://forums.d2jsp.org) - Modified by Jeroen Post for the original benchmark script.

To insert results run ```php_bench.sql``` onto your databse and edit in the connection details (lines 441-444 bench.php).
